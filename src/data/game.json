            "Two pieces of rock orbit you; the maids. The first, Ligeia; the second, Syntyche. Contented and mute, they attract you — as much as you attract them. They are bound by tradition and  by the echoing vibrations you emitted when they were born: “Not. Forget. Give. Life.”",
            "You are disturbed by a rumbling and a trembling that propagate from deep inside your core. A presence pulsating inside you, silently. It casts light onto the depths of your stony mind. Upward shrills; grinding rock; spinning particles; roars that stop when they reach the vacuum outside you. In a shocked stupor, you mumble ideas that are not yours. An order: “Prepare. Move. Consort. Approach. Poseidon.” Then, your voice is your own again and you prepare a reply."
